description: Physical product tokenization protocol for Web 3.0 economy on Bitcoin
---

# ☀ Welcome to Ordinals:goods

## Overview

We offer a novel mechanic of tokenization of future streams of commoditized products and services as a lightweight web 3.0 method of digital transformation for businesses, ensuring working capital for goods production and broadening customer base.

Tokenized products themselves and subscriptions for future deliveries will form two layers of non-fungible tokens living in a global Ordinals decentralized ecosystem. All tokens will represent an obligation of the legally incorporated business - a DAO LLC in the USA, owning a share or other form of security issued by the business.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Ordinal Theory** together with the first implementation of the Ordinals indexer (Ord) and wallets appeared at the very beginning of 2023 on the Bitcoin blockchain, and the whole development was possible due to the latest innovation of the Bitcoin protocol – Taproot. Ordinal Inscriptions has seen an explosion in its user base, and the rate of growth in this space is impressive, with some projects already demonstrating billion-dollar valuations.
{% endhint %}

The core protocol includes a special format of Ordinals Inscription, using Ordinals Recursions and an indexer–oracle, managing the integration of Ordinals NFTs into the CRM flow of the SMEs, and validating the authenticity of inscriptions (and their inclusion into collections).

The essential product nature of the tokens issued by DAO enables unrestricted circulation in the Bitcoin decentralized economy and trade on decentralized Ordinals PSBT marketplaces.

The protocol is easily extensible and supports PSBT smart contracts not only for secondary market trades, but for complex mechanics of appending viable information about products, deliveries, issuing status updates, and even additional layers of tokens such as coupons or tickets, eligible only for business clients.

We envision the protocol to find a niche, especially in SMEs offering mass-market commoditized products, such as various farming, apiaries, wholesale, etc., requiring significant working capital commitments, lengthy production cycles with regular stable production, often with a focus on sustainability and ecological awareness. We believe using the number #1 blockchain platform, Bitcoin, will simplify onboarding even for non-crypto-savvy audiences.
