# üèÜ Certificates

For enabling additional post-issuance lifecycle of issued goods, the protocol allows issuing certificates, containing arbitrary data, that will be logically appended to the goods' inscriptions and can affect their state.

Certificates enable a wide variety of business cases, including tracking of collectibles, secondary market trading of redeemed items, DeFi.

{% hint style="info" %}
Certificates, intended to append information about the goods (items and subscriptions), track their lifecycle, and provide instruments for community engagements such as tickets and coupons, are also represented as individual inscriptions and must reference a valid Goods inscription (item or subscription).

The protocol allows the holder of the item or subscription to inscribe "messages", while the DAO address can also inscribe "certificates" and "bearer" certificate inscriptions.
